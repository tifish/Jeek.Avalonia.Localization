# Jeek.Avalonia.Localization
Avalonia string localization support.

- Switch language at runtime.
- Customizable language file format and location.
- Simple interface, simple implementation.

## Origin

- I found [Localizing using ResX | Avalonia Docs (avaloniaui.net)](https://docs.avaloniaui.net/docs/guides/implementation-guides/localizing) in Avalonia website. It's static and can't switch language at runtime.
- Then I found this article: [Avalonia UI Framework localization | Sakya's Homepage](https://www.sakya.it/wordpress/avalonia-ui-framework-localization/), and learn much from it. Finally I created my own version, more simple and flexible.
